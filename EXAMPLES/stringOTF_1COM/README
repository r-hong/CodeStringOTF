Please refer to the tutorial for a general workflow to prepare the files and run these calculations.
Additional information is provided here about the files involved in this calculation
The folder structure for this calculation is the following:
./           # run files (see bellow)      
/INPUT/      # (1) coordinate, velocities, box dimension and topologies for the initial string,(2) file initialPcurve.dat 
/OUTPUT/     # IDEM to folder INPUT, but for every iteration of the OTF string method.


Now we give a general description of the files in the main folder

OTF_string.sh        | main script with the framework for the OTF string method calculation.
reparam.f90          | fortran code for the reparametrizatio; default variables correspond to a calculation with 3 collective variables
                     | this code contains indications on how to change it and use 6 collective variables (coordinates of 2 centers of mass)

reparametrization.x  | executable from reparam.f90
TMP_COORD.namd       | namd configuration file (normal OTF calculation)
TMP_COORD_FIXED.namd | namd configuration file (for points on the curve that we want to keep fixed, without evolving the forces)
namd_OTF.tcl         | script for namd tcl forces (normal OTF calculation) 
namd_OTF_FIXED.tcl   | script for namd tcl forces (for points on the curve that we want to keep fixed, without evolving forces)
CV_config.in         | configuration file to use the collective variable module. Is use to stop translations/rotations on the receptor
fixed.pdb            | pdb file with the reference positions to restrain the translations/rotations on the receptor
